In the past decades we have witnessed major advances in the power of automated
reasoning engines like Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) and Horn clause
solvers. As a consequence, there has been a renaissance of software
verification based on this technology. Currently, there are a number of mature
verifiers available coming both from academia and industry. However, despite
these advances, the bar for newcomer researchers to contribute to this field is
still very high. One of the main obstacles is the very large cost of
development of a new software verifier from scratch. Hence, several groups have
been independently working on implementing open software verification
infrastructures, which would allow for easier prototyping of research ideas in
this space, e.g., new algorithms for verifying relational or timing properties,
thereby democratizing software verification.

This workshop aims to bring together the developers of open software
verification infrastructures and their potential clients, meaning researchers
and practitioners interested in developing prototypes of software verification
algorithms. We will structure the workshop to facilitate the exchange of ideas
and discussions between the developers and clients. Hence, the workshop will
include invited talks on core verification infrastructures as well as
presentations of projects that already leverage these infrastructures. We also
hope to attract potential new clients as well, who would present the
requirements of their projects through a series of lightning talks. Through
open discussions we will solicit feedback from the community on the
requirements and functionality that open research infrastructures should
include to make them more widely usable.

As further discussion topics, we will solicit talks and feedback on
benchmarking issues, reproducibility, input languages, and potential license
issues, all of which are important to have a viable software verification
research ecosystem that can be leveraged by both industry and academia.

## Invited Speakers

### Elizabeth Polgreen (University of Edinburgh) and Yatin Manerkar (University of Michigan):
*UCLID5: Multi-Modal Formal Modeling, Verification, and Synthesis*

**Abstract:**
UCLID5 is a tool for the multi-modal formal modeling, verification, and
synthesis of systems. It enables one to tackle verification problems for
heterogeneous systems such as combinations of hardware and software, or those
that have multiple, varied specifications, or systems that require hybrid modes
of modeling. A novel aspect of UCLID5 is an emphasis on the use of
syntax-guided and inductive synthesis to automate steps in modeling and
verification. In this talk we will present new developments in the UCLID5 tool
including new language features, integration with new techniques for
syntax-guided synthesis and satisfiability solving, support for hyperproperties
and combinations of axiomatic and operational modeling, demonstrations on new
problem classes, and a robust implementation.

**Short bios:**
Yatin A. Manerkar is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and
Engineering Division at the University of Michigan. His research lies on the
boundary between formal methods and computer architecture, and develops
automated formal methdologies and tools for the design and verification of
computing systems. He is a contributor to the UCLID5 verification framework.

Elizabeth Polgreen is an Assistant Professor in the School of Informatics
at the University of Edinburgh. Her research focuses on formal synthesis and
verification, and the integration of the two. She is one of the main developers
of the UCLID5 tool, so please get in touch with her if you have applications
for UCLID5 in mind.
